  description
    "This module contains a collection of YANG definitions for
     supporting the Broadband Forum requirements on management of
     ITU-T Passive Optical Network (PON) interfaces as defined in
     ITU-T G.984.x, G.987.x, ITU-T G.989.x and ITU-T G.9807.x. As
     such, this module is specific to access network equipment (e.g.,
     BBF-specified Access Nodes and FTTdp DPUs).

     Specifically, this module contains a collection of YANG
     definitions common to Optical Network Unit (ONU) power
     management.

       supports the Optical Network Unit (ONU) in a 'Watch' low power

       indications. When the downstream signal is checked, the ONU
       does not respond to bandwidth allocations and does not forward
       downstream traffic. This state persists for a configurable
       duration if not truncated by the arrival of a local stimulus.

       The OLT CT provides normal allocations to the ONU but expects
       only intermittent responses from the ONU to bandwidth grants,
