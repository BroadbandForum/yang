    "This module contains a collection of YANG definitions for
     supporting the Broadband Forum requirements on the management of
     sub-interfaces as applicable to access network equipment. As
     such, this module is specific to access network equipment (e.g.,
     BBF-specified Access Nodes and FTTdp DPUs).

     Specifically, this module defines generic groupings that can be
     used when defining frame processing data nodes.

      "Provides a generic framework of frame-processing, i.e., define
       the data nodes supporting a list of ingress rules with a
       corresponding ingress-rewrite, and an egress-rewrite.

       The frame processing refers to both directions:
       - Ingress, which refers to frames received from the
         lower-layer interface.
       - Egress, which refers to frames received from a higher-layer
         interface, or from a forwarder, and to be transmitted to the
         lower-layer interface.
       - In the ingress direction classification criteria identify
         whether a received frame shall be offered to this
         sub-interface.
       - For both the ingress and egress direction tag manipulations
         can be supported.";

           matches with other rules, then execute the
           ingress-rewrite actions specified in this rule.";

            "This field indicates the priority for applying the
             match criteria of this rule against the priority of
             match criteria of other rules of this and other
             sub-interfaces on the same parent-interface.

             The higher the value, the lower the priority, i.e.,
             priority 1 is the highest priority.

             Note that priorities of rules do not have to be unique
             within a lower-layer interface. For example, if there
             is no overlap in the 'flexible-match' criteria of a
             different sub-interfaces having the same lower-layer
             interface, then the configuration is still unambiguous.
             If different sub-interfaces with the same lower-layer
             interface are configured such that there is overlap
             between their flexible-match criteria, then unambiguity
             is achieved by configuring the rules with different
             priorities. If the priority is configured equal,
             despite having overlapping match criteria, then the
             device's behavior is undefined, meaning, it can be
             different in different devices, even more it can be
             different in single device over time.";
