    "This module contains a collection of YANG definitions for
     supporting the Broadband Forum requirements on management of Very
     High-speed Digital Subscriber Line (VDSL) interfaces as defined
     in ITU-T G.993.x, ITU-T G.997.1 and BBF TR-252. As such, this
     module is specific to access network equipment (e.g.,
     BBF-specified Access Nodes and FTTdp DPUs).
