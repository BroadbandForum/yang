  description
    "This module contains a collection of YANG definitions for 
     supporting the Broadband Forum requirements on interface 
     management as applicable to access network equipment. As such, 
     this module is specific to access network equipment (e.g., 
     BBF-specified Access Nodes and FTTdp DPUs).

     Specifically, this module augments ietf-interfaces with a reset
     action for statistics.
