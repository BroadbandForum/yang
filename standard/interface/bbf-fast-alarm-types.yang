    "This module contains a collection of YANG definitions for
     supporting the Broadband Forum requirements on management of
     FAST interfaces as defined in ITU-T G.9700, ITU-T G.9701, ITU-T
     G.997.2 and BBF TR-371. As such, this module is specific to
     access network equipment (e.g., BBF-specified Access Nodes and
     FTTdp DPUs).

     Specifically, this module contains a set of alarm definitions
     related to FAST interfaces.
