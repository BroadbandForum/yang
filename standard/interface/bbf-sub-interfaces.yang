  description
    "This module contains a collection of YANG definitions for
     supporting the Broadband Forum requirements on the management of
     sub-interfaces as applicable to access network equipment. As
     such, this module is specific to access network equipment (e.g.,
     BBF-specified Access Nodes and FTTdp DPUs).

     Specifically, this module augments an interface with
     sub-interface-specific frame processing configuration.
