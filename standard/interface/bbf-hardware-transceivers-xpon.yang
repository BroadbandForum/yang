  description
    "This module contains a collection of YANG definitions for
     supporting the Broadband Forum requirements on management of
     ITU-T Passive Optical Network (PON) interfaces as defined in
     ITU-T G.984.x, G.987.x, ITU-T G.989.x and ITU-T G.9807.x. As
     such, this module is specific to access network equipment (e.g.,
     BBF-specified Access Nodes and FTTdp DPUs).

     Specifically, this module augments the bbf-hardware-transceivers
     model to define transceiver data specific to PON applications.
