  description
    "This module contains a collection of YANG definitions for
     supporting the Broadband Forum requirements on hardware
     management as applicable to access network equipment. As such,
     this module is specific to access network equipment (e.g.,
     BBF-specified Access Nodes and FTTdp DPUs).

     Specifically, this module augments the ietf-hardware model with
     the management of storage drives.
