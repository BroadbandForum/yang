  description
    "This module contains a collection of YANG definitions for
     supporting the Broadband Forum requirements on hardware
     management as applicable to access network equipment.
     As such, this module is specific to access network equipment
     (e.g., BBF-specified Access Nodes and FTTdp DPUs).

     Specifically, this module contains a set of alarm definitions
     related to the management of compact transceivers.
