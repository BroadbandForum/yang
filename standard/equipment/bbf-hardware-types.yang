  description
    "This module contains a collection of YANG definitions for
     supporting the Broadband Forum requirements on reusable data
     types as applicable to access network equipment. As such, this
     module is specific to access network equipment (e.g.,
     BBF-specified Access Nodes and FTTdp DPUs).

     Specifically, this module specializes types defined in the
     iana-hardware model.
