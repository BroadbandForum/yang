  description
    "This module contains a collection of YANG definitions for
     supporting the Broadband Forum requirements on the management
     of alarms as applicable to access network equipment. As such,
     this module is specific to access network equipment (e.g.,
     BBF-specified Access Nodes and FTTdp DPUs).

     Specifically, this module defines abstract alarm types that are
     needed for BBF applications to be able to define their own
     specific abstract and concrete alarm types.
