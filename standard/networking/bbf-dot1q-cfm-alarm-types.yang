  description
    "This module contains a collection of YANG definitions for
     supporting the Broadband Forum requirements on Connectivity Fault
     Management (CFM) Operations, Administration, and Maintenance
     (OAM) as applicable to access network equipment. As such, this
     module is specific to access network equipment (e.g.,
     BBF-specified Access Nodes and FTTdp DPUs).

     Specifically, this module contains a set of alarm definitions.
