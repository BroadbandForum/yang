  description
    "This module contains a collection of YANG definitions for
     supporting the Broadband Forum requirements on layer 2 multicast
     management as applicable to access network equipment. As such,
     this module is specific to access network equipment (e.g.,
     BBF-specified Access Nodes and FTTdp DPUs).

     Specifically,this module contains a collection of YANG
     definitions for supporting the Multicast Group Membership
     Discovery (MGMD) Protocols. In particular, it describes data
     nodes used for managing the Internet Group Management Protocol
     (IGMP) and the Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) protocol in
     systems that act as a multicast proxy, snooper, or a snooper with
     proxy reporting.
