  description
    "This module contains a collection of YANG definitions for
     supporting the Broadband Forum requirements on the Access Node
     Control Protocol (ANCP) as defined in RFC 6320. As such, this
     module is specific to access network equipment (e.g.,
     BBF-specified Access Nodes and FTTdp DPUs).

     Specifically, this module contains a set of alarm definitions.
