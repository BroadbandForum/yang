  description
    "This module is part of a collection of YANG definitions for
     supporting the Broadband Forum requirements on Connectivity Fault
     Management (CFM) Operations, Administration, and Maintenance
     (OAM) as applicable to access network equipment. As such, this
     module is specific to access network equipment (e.g., BBF-
     specified Access Nodes and FTTdp DPUs).

     Specifically, this module augments the IEEE 802.1Qcx CFM YANG
     data model to provide data nodes to report Maintenance Points
     present on an interface, i.e., the CFM stack of an interface.
