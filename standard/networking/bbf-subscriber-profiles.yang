  description
    "This module contains a collection of YANG definitions for 
     supporting the Broadband Forum requirements on the management of
     subscribers as applicable to access network equipment. As such, 
     this module is specific to access network equipment (e.g., 
     BBF-specified Access Nodes and FTTdp DPUs).

     Specifically, this module defines subscriber profiles.
