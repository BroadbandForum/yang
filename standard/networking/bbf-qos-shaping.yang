  description
    "This module contains a collection of YANG definitions for
     supporting the Broadband Forum requirements on the management of
     Quality of Service (QoS) as applicable to access network
     equipment. As such, this module is specific to access network
     equipment (e.g., BBF-specified Access Nodes and FTTdp DPUs).

     Specifically, this module augments traffic management profiles
     with shaper profiles and augments interfaces to reference a
     shaper profile.
