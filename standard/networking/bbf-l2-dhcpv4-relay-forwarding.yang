  description
    "This module contains a collection of YANG definitions for
     supporting the Broadband Forum requirements on subscriber
     management via the DHCPv4 protocol as applicable to access
     network equipment. As such, this module is specific to access
     network equipment (e.g., BBF-specified Access Nodes and FTTdp
     DPUs).

     Specifically, this module augments bbf-l2-forwarding with
     subscriber management via the DHCPv4 protocol.
