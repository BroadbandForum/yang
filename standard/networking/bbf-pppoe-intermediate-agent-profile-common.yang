  description
    "This module contains a collection of YANG definitions for
     supporting the Broadband Forum requirements on subscriber
     management via the PPPoE protocol as applicable to access
     network equipment. As such, this module is specific to access
     network equipment (e.g., BBF-specified Access Nodes and FTTdp
     DPUs).

     Specifically, this module contains the definition of a profile
     for subscriber information used by a PPPoE Intermediate Agent in
     creating an Agent Circuit ID and Remote ID as described in
     TR-101i2.
