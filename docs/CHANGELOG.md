# OD-360: OD-360 Change Log

OD-360 provides a set of Best Current Practices for development of YANG Data Models in the Broadband Forum (BBF). The approach taken in establishing a set of best current practices is to utilize existing practices where those are relevant to the work of the Forum. The guidelines put forth by this document not only provide guidance for authors of BBF YANG models but are also enforced prior to YANG model publication to ensure a high level of quality and consistency across BBF projects.
